# Cactus_Alignments_Tools
The toolbox used to deal with cactus whole genome alignments

Requirement:
https://github.com/ComparativeGenomicsToolkit/hal.git
And add the bin to your PATH

How to use:
You could use the extract_shell.pl to create the work shell. 

Known bug:
*this will be deal with recently
There is a bug with the coordinate calculation to target species while it doesn't influence the alignments filtering. If there is some short insetion, it would disorganize the coordinate calculation. But the reference coordinates and the sequences of alignments are right.
